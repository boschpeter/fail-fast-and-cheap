Use version control to save your work and coordinate code changes across your team. Even if you're just a single developer, version control helps you stay organized as you fix bugs and develop new features. Version control keeps a history of your development so that you can review and even rollback to any version of your code with ease.

The steps in the following tutorials show how to perform common version controls tasks using the following version control workflow.

|---------------------------------------------------|
|Get a local copy of code if they don't have one yet.|
|Make changes to code to fix bugs or add new features.|
|Once the code is ready, make it available for review by your team.|
|Once the code is reviewed, merge it into the team's shared codebase.|
