Create a complete local copy of an existing Git repository by cloning it. 
Cloning a repo downloads all commits and branches in the repo. 
Cloning sets up a named relationship with the existing repo you cloned. 
Use this relationship to interact with the existing repo, 
pushing and pulling changes to share code with your team.

By default, Git assigns the origin to the remote repo you clone from. Most users don't need more than one remote, \
so the tutorial uses origin in its steps. Learn more about setting up remotes to your Git repo.

    Get the clone URL to your repo
